vithesaurus - a web-based thesaurus management tool
Copyright (C) 2009 vionto GmbH, www.vionto.com

vithesaurus is a web-based tool for the development and maintenance of 
thesauri and ontologies. It requires a Java application server or
servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, http://tomcat.apache.org) and is
typically used with a stand-alone database (some non-basic features use
Oracle-specific SQL syntax).


BUILDING

You need Grails 1.0.4 (http://www.grails.org) if you want to build
vithesaurus on your own. 

Use "grails war" to build a web application which can be deployed to a Java
servlet container like Tomcat. Use "grails run-app" to directly start the
web-application in development mode. It is then available at
http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus.


SETUP

After configuring your database access in 
WEB-INF/classes/datasource.properties (production environment)
and/or grails-app/conf/datasource-dev.properties (development environment),
copy your JDBC database connector to the "lib" directory.

A typical MySQL-based configuration for datasource.properties looks like this:

dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/vithesaurus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8
dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
dataSource.username=dbuser
dataSource.password=xyz
dataSource.dbCreate=update

The default administration account is "admin" with the password "admin" - make
sure this is changed after your first login.


DATA IMPORT

Data from the old PHP version of OpenThesaurus can be imported by
calling http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus/import/index. Please check
the result carefully as it has only been tested with the German data
so far.
