vithesaurus - a web-based thesaurus management tool
Copyright (C) 2009 vionto GmbH, www.vionto.com

vithesaurus is a web-based tool for the development and
maintenance of thesauri and ontologies. It requires
Grails 1.0.4 and is typically used with a stand-alone
database (some non-basic features use Oracle-specific
SQL syntax).

After configuring your database access in 
grails-app/conf/datasource.properties
and
grails-app/conf/datasource-dev.properties,
copy your JDBC database connector to the lib directory.

A typical MySQL-based configuration for datasource.properties looks like this:
dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/vithesaurus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8
dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
dataSource.username=dbuser
dataSource.password=xxx
dataSource.dbCreate=update

Use "grails war" to build a web application which can be
deployed to a Java servlet container like Tomcat
(http://tomcat.apache.org/). Use "grails run-app" to
directly start the web-application in development mode.
