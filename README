vithesaurus - a web-based thesaurus management tool
Copyright (C) 2009 vionto GmbH, www.vionto.com

vithesaurus is a web-based tool for the development and maintenance of 
thesauri and ontologies. It requires a Java application server or
servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, http://tomcat.apache.org) and is
typically used with MySQL as a stand-alone database (other databases may
work but have not been tested).


SETUP FOR USERS WHO INSTALL THE *.WAR FILE

The vithesaurus.war file needs to be deployed to your servlet container.
Please refer to the container's documentation on how to do that.

Configure your database access in WEB-INF/classes/datasource.properties 
and copy your JDBC database connector JAR file to the "WEB-INF/lib" directory.

A typical MySQL-based configuration for datasource.properties looks like this:

dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/vithesaurus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8
dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
dataSource.username=dbuser
dataSource.password=xyz
dataSource.dbCreate=update

With the settings, the database "vithesaurus" needs to be created first manually
using the database's tools. The tables will be automatically created by vithesaurus
on its first startup.

The default administration account is "admin" with the password "admin" - make
sure this is changed after your first login. If you are logged in as admin, the
vithesaurus homepage will show a link to the administration page. 

For now, an in-memory database needs to be set up and updated regularly by
calling "synset/createMemoryDatabase" before vithesaurus can be used.
This can be done by calling a command like this:
curl -I http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus/synset/createMemoryDatabase

For bigger data sets it might be necessary to created indexes manually in
your database (later versions of vithesaurus might do this automatically):
 ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `word` ) 
 ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `normalized_word` ) 
 ALTER TABLE `synset` ADD INDEX ( `is_visible` ) 


BUILDING

If you want to build vithsaurus on your own you will need
Grails 1.1.1 (http://www.grails.org) 

For development, your database needs to be configured in
grails-app/conf/datasource-dev.properties. Use "grails run-app"
to directly start the web-application in development mode. It is
then available at http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus.

Use "grails war" to build a web application which can be deployed to a Java
servlet container like Tomcat.


DATA IMPORT

Data from the old PHP version of OpenThesaurus can be imported by
calling http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus/import/index. Please check
the result carefully as it has only been tested with the German data
so far.
